Patient Monitor Belt (Particle Argon)An intelligent patient safety system built on the Particle Argon platform. This wearable belt monitors patient vitals (temperature), detects falls in real-time, tracks orientation (standing vs. lying down), and provides indoor room-level location tracking using BLE beacons.## Key FeaturesFall Detection: Uses the MPU6050 accelerometer to detect free-fall events with a 300ms confirmation window to minimize false alarms.Department Tracking: Automatically detects "Pediatric" or "Cardiac" departments via RSSI proximity to dedicated Particle Argon beacons.Posture Monitoring: Real-time orientation tracking to determine if a patient is standing or lying down.Temperature Sensing:<6> Continuous monitoring of ambient/body temperature via the MPU6050 internal sensor.</6>Cloud Integration: Publishes JSON payloads to the Particle Cloud, including a pre-formatted Google Maps link for the facility location.Learning Mode: A "One-Touch" pairing system using the Argon's Mode button to register a patient's specific phone or smartwatch.## Hardware Configuration### ComponentsMicrocontroller: Particle Argon<7>Sensor: MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)</7>Indication: Onboard D7 LED (Learning Mode Indicator)Power: 5V USB (Wall/Power bank)### Wiring DiagramMPU6050 PinArgon PinNotesVCC3.3VPowerGNDGNDGroundSCLD1I2C ClockSDAD0I2C Data## Software SetupFlash Firmware: Upload the provided .ino code to your Argon via the Particle Web IDE or Workbench.Configure Beacons: Update the arg1Address and arg2Address constants in the code with the MAC addresses of your department beacons.Particle Webhook: Create a Webhook in the Particle Console to listen for the following events:status: Regular presence and health updates.falling: High-priority emergency alerts.department: Room/Area transitions.## How to Use### 1. Pairing a Device (Learning Mode)Press the MODE button on the Argon. The Blue LED (D7) will turn ON.Hold the patient's phone or BLE device near the belt.The Argon will automatically capture the MAC address, save it to EEPROM, and turn the LED OFF. The device is now tracked.### 2. Remote CommandsYou can trigger the following actions via the setStatus Particle Function:on / off: Enable or disable location reporting.fall: Manually trigger a test fall alert.info: Force an immediate status update (Temp, Orientation, etc.).## Payload StructureThe device publishes data in a compact JSON format for easy parsing by external dashboards:JSON{
  "name": "Patient_Phone",
  "status": "here",
  "location": "http://google.com/maps/...",
  "department": "Pediatric dept",
  "orientation": "standing",
  "temperature": 32.50
